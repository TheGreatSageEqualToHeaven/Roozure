<hr />

**Roozure** is a tool designed to automatically obfuscate script packages to make exploiting games harder.

## What Roozure Is
Roozure is 

<div>A utility to prevent exploiters from reading your source code efficiently</div>
<div>A utility to prevent exploiters from hooking your code </div>
<div>A utility to prevent exploiters from dumping information from your code</div>

Roozure is not 

<div>A security measure for your remotes</div>
<div>A complete prevention to exploiting</div>
<div>A lossless security measure (Debugging information will be worse)</div>

## Features

* Obfuscating a single script
* Obfuscating a folder of scripts

In the future Roozure will be able to:
 
* Obfuscate scripts with a fast Luau vm
* Use an external module script for storing constants
